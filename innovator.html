                            <p class="">
                              Cynthia Breazeal was born in 1967 in New Mexico as
                              a daughter of two scientists. She later moved with
                              her family to grow up in California.  Growing up
                              she had a piqued interest in robots after watching
                              Star Wars. She had guidance from her parents to
                              pursue her dreams of creating robots that could
                              integrate with humans and be used for social good.
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                              She got her Bachelor of Science in Electrical and
                              Computer Engineering from the University of
                              California in Santa Barbara in 1989. After that,
                              she was still ready to take on more. In 1993,
                              Breazeal applied to the Massachusetts Institute of
                              Technology and was accepted to complete a master's
                              in electrical engineering. Breazeal also went on
                              to complete her PhD at MIT as well in electrical
                              engineering and computing in 2000 (Wikipedia).

                            <h2 class="mb-3">Kismet</h2>
                            <p class="">
                              While Breazeal was at MIT earning her Master’s,
                              she was apart of a team who created Kismet, a
                              robot head that was programmed to sense human
                              emotions based off of ques. The robot vitalized
                              human psychology to make it resemble human
                              emotions as closely as possible. Kismet has
                              movable eyelids, eyebrows, mouth, and ears to give
                              a wide range of emotions. The robot can “express”
                              moods such as anger, fear, sadness or sleep.
                              However, it is important to note, even from
                              Breazeal herself, Kismet is not conscious as she
                              states in her book. Breazeal reported it took 2.5
                              years of full-time work to get the code behind
                              Kismet to work.
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                              Kismet has motion sensors that can detect eye
                              contact and even skin color. Breazeal describes
                              her relationship such as a caretaker teaching an
                              infant about the world. In a video titled, “How
                              Kismet Works” on YouTube, the creators behind the
                              robot explain how he works. Kismet wants social
                              stimulation and becomes “sad” when he doesn’t
                              sense anyone or have any stimuli. Kismet’s voice
                              is similar to infant babbling but changes tone to
                              convey an emotion more clearly how a human would.

                            <p class="">
                              In 2002, Breazeal published her book diving into
                              the intricacies and possibilities of social
                              robotics. Breazeal strongly advocates for robots
                              to integrate with human life to not only serve us,
                              but to communicate and serve as companions. The
                              publication has a strong tie to her work done at
                              MIT with Kismet, the robot head. She discusses
                              what went into developing the complex robot, such
                              as studying animal and human behavior as well as
                              learning about animatronics.

                            <p class="">
                              Named after the amazing artist, Leonardo is a
                              robotic piece of art. Breazeal finished working on
                              this robot in 2002. He is similar to Kismet, but
                              was given a warmer appearance. Instead of the
                              metal wiring needed for Kismet showing, Leonardo
                              is wrapped in fur and less stereotypical
                              robot-like.
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                              Aside from appearance, Leonardo is more
                              complicated than Kismet. He has over 50 motors to
                              control movement to appear as lifelike as
                              possible. He has abilites such as looking where
                              humans tell him to, mimicing people he is around
                              and he can even explore on his own. The goal with
                              Leonardo was to have an untrianed person be able
                              to interact with him and see the benefits of
                              social robotics.

                              This dragon-like robot, named Kombusto, was
                              designed to act as a teaching aid for
                              pre-schoolers. It’s made from an android phone
                              that users see as his face, which may seem less
                              intricate than previous designs, but it does keep
                              the cost low. Keeping down the cost would allow
                              this robot to possible be used in a variety of
                              schools, not only affluent ones.

                              robots could aid teaching and increase curiosity
                              in children. MIT sampled their design with real
                              children who used the robot to tell and create
                              stories by their input. The children could click
                              and drag images and allow their creativity to take
                              them where they liked. In the study, they found
                              all the children over the two month period
                              expanded their vocabulary, created new stories and
                              overall, enjoyed the social robot. Pico outputs
                              were done by humans, but better technology
                              advancement could be used.

                              Jibo is Breazeal’s most recent robot meant for the
                              home and everyday people. This jumps off of
                              Leonardo, as the goal was for untrained people to
                              be able to interact with him. Jibo’s key feature
                              is household integreation. Jibo could take family
                              photos so everyone is included, remind users of
                              their schedule and track faces. Jibo is able to
                              connect with all ages, such as by storytelling for
                              children.

                              Breazeal’s design is a sharp contrast from her
                              past work. Jibo has a sleek, monochrome design
                              instead of fur and more child friendly. Breazeal
                              speaks on this by stating the design choice was
                              deliberate, and she aims for Jibo to be seen as a
                              useful tool and not a toy.
