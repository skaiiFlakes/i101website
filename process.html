                              Our team began this project by conducting
                              individual research on underrepresented innovators
                              in the fields of technology, computer science, and
                              informatics. Each team member researched 2
                              innovators and recorded how the innovator was
                              underrepresented, what challenges they faced and
                              how they overcame them, and what contributions
                              they made in their respective field.

                            <p class="">
                              Our team came together and discussed who we wanted
                              to highlight for this project. We decided on
                              Cynthia Breazeal because we think that her
                              research in the field of social robotics will be
                              extremely important in the coming years.
                              Additionally, we found it inspiring that her
                              experience having children helps motivate her
                              work, as children are often thought of as a burden
                              on working women. We also created a project
                              charter, which outlined our innovator choice,
                              project timeline, and backup plans in the event of
                              exposures.

                              During this week, our team gathered more in depth
                              information about Breazeal as well as media
                              assets. We learned about her general life, how she
                              is underrepresented in the field of technology,
                              her contributions to robotics, and the future
                              promise of her research. This information is
                              covered on the About and Innovations pages.

                              At this point in the project we created the
                              website framework for how we wanted the website to
                              look. We took other websites into consideration
                              for what style we wanted to convey. In the end, we
                              chose a modern style. Our team searched the
                              internet for visuals that would enhance the
                              websites feel without overcrowding it and losing
                              focus. We made sure to include information about
                              Breazeal as well as information on our team and
                              this process page.

                              Working off of the wireframe, it was time to
                              create the real website. Having a structured
                              blueprint to work off of was immensely helpful in
                              our website coming to life. Similar to the
                              wireframe, separate pages were created to give our
                              website depth. With our draft, there were still
                              some sections left uncompleted, which we worked on
                              the following week.

                              This week, we took our website and tested it with
                              real users. Each member of our team interviewed
                              someone and gave them full access to the website.
                              We had assigned tasks we needed them to do to test
                              our website's navigation. Overall, the users found
                              our site easy to navigate. We got some great
                              critiques on how to further improve the website
                              from an outside perspective that none of us
                              thought of.

                              those suggestions as well as the presentation. The
                              presentation was a large overview of Cynthia

                    We found that several of our test users had issues
                    navigating the website due to non-functioning buttons. In
                    response to this, we made sure to streamline the final
                    website to be as simple and user friendly as possible. This
                    also compliments the minimalist aesthetic of our website,
                    which test users generally liked. Other feedback was mostly
                    minor errors such as spelling errors and removing filler
                    text. This feedback was also valuable, as small mistakes
                    like this are typically easier to find for people not
                    already familiar with the website.

                  <p class="">
                    Our group worked greatly together by splitting up our work
                    and keeping each member accountable. Every milestone, we had
                    set tasks of what we needed to do and who was submitting. If
                    someone needed a reminder, any of us could kindly text in
                    our group chat and we would respond quickly. For tips for
                    future groups, we could all recommend taking criticism and
                    using it to improve and not take it personally. If we had to
                    do it all over again, we agreed we could have started
                    assignments earlier to not feel rushed at the end of the
                    week. For the most part, we would be done early but a couple
                    milestones required more effort. Our group had a relaxed
                    atmosphere while still able to get things done, and that
                    helped tremendously. All of us never felt worried about
                    asking for help from one another.
